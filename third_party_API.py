'''
A third party API is less customizable but can be more powerful.
typically these APIs require an API key (stored in .env for now) that can be retrieved from their website.
You can stack your own logic on top of another API to add more functionality or you can just use theirs as is.

In this example I am getting weather data from a weather API. This will return to me the data of weather from a city that
I request from.
